Professional README Generator
# Description
The Professional README Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional-quality README.md file for your project. By simply using the command node index.js, the application will prompt you for details about your project, including the title, description, installation instructions, usage information, and more. It then compiles this information into a well-structured README file to save you time and ensure that your README adheres to professional standards.

This project uses the Inquirer package to interact with the user and collect the necessary data to generate the README file.
